Option 1 : Core is in default layer and doesn't change
	+ All net and logic code is kept in the Player script
	- Special logic is implemented not to change core collider specifically 
	= Have an overload extension ignore a specified layer 
	= Bundle all colliders into a single game object, and then feed that into the player controller 
 	= Reset core layer to default after layer changes 

Option 2 : Have the core initiate death/respawn when it detects a collision 
	+ Simple
	+ Can remove objects inside count 
	- Logic is split into the core now
	- Requires setup in the Player script (can't have net code in children object) 
	- (Untested) player may jut out of the object (as the real colliders will push the player out) 
	= Have OnTriggerEnter call a function in the Player script 

Option 3 : Physics sphere cast when changing
	+ no seperate object 
	+ no seperate script 
	+ not constantly checking
	- not setup yet or tested (not sure if it'll work)
	- not visual (can't easily see bounds of cast)
	- (Untested) will always hit self
	- Need more logic to check what player is colliding with 
		- using the logic from before, could just check if >1 checks (more than body is scanned, currently in something) 
	= Implement function to do a small spherecast in players body to check if more than one object is detected.
